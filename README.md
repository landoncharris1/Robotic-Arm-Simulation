# Robotic-Arm-Simulation
This repository contains the design and simulation of a robotic arm, developed using Autodesk Inventor and MATLAB/Simulink. The project includes detailed 3D models, engineering drawings, and a system integration framework for virtual testing and analysis.
# Key Features 
• 3D Modeling: Designed a robotic arm in Autodesk Inventor, with comprehensive 3D models and engineering drawings.

• System Integration: Imported the 3D model into MATLAB/Simulink to integrate with system-level simulations.

• Virtual Testing: Conducted simulations to evaluate the robotic arm’s kinematics, dynamics, and control algorithms.

• Performance Optimization: Fine-tuned the control algorithms to enhance the arm’s functionality and performance.

# Setup Instructions
Prerequisites-
• Solidworks 2001Plus and higher or Autodesk Inventor 2009-2021: For viewing and modifying the 3D models and engineering drawings.

• MATLAB/Simulink: For running the simulations and system integration.

• Simulink 3D Animation Toolbox (optional): For enhanced visualization of the robotic arm in the simulation environment.

# Installing Simscape Multibody
• Simscape™ Multibody™ Link is a plugin that you can install on CAD applications to export assembly models to Simscape Multibody. Specifically, the plugin exports a CAD assembly model as an XML file and body geometry files that you can convert into Simscape Multibody models using the smimport function. The plugin supports:

SolidWorks®

Autodesk Inventor®

PTC®Creo™
